# mac-minikube-config

Holds the Kubernetes manifests to set up the minikube cluster on my local Mac. Synced with ArgoCD, also running on the
same minikube cluster.

If using ArgoCD, create a new ArgoCD Application for each dir with the command-line or the UI.

Check the README in each dir to see if deploying those manifests will require any secrets.
